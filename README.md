<h1>Attendance Management System</h1>
<br>The Attendance Management System transforms traditional methods of tracking 
student attendance by seamlessly connecting courses, students, faculty, attendance 
sheets, and student-class mappings. This dynamic solution simplifies the management 
of course details, student information, faculty records, and attendance data through
an intuitive user interface. It captures precise student attendance on specific dates,
establishing connections using unique identifiers. Foreign keys strategically link attendance records 
to dedicated faculty members and specific courses. The innovative student-course mapping 
feature facilitates clear associations between students and their enrolled courses. 
This system not only automates attendance tracking but also ensures data consistency,
making it an essential tool for educational institutions committed to operational excellence.</br>
